      "excerpt": "The Michelin-starred chef brings a new wave of sushi and sake to Torontos waterfront district.",
      "content": "Akira Back is a name synonymous with culinary excellence. His latest venture, Tono, is no exception. Located in the heart of Toronto's burgeoning waterfront, Tono offers a sensory journey that defies traditional expectations of Japanese dining.\n\nThe space itself is a marvel of architectural design—think brutalist concrete meets soft, organic wood textures. As you step inside, the low-lit atmosphere immediately signals that you're in for something special.\n\nThe menu is a daring exploration of flavor. From the signature \"Tuna Pizza\" with truffle oil to the delicate \"Crispy Rice\" topped with spicy tuna, every dish is a testament to Back's unique ability to blend his Korean heritage with Japanese precision.\n\nWe sat down with Executive Chef Michael Chen to discuss the vision behind Tono. \"We wanted to create something that feels like a celebration,\" Chen explains. \"Every plate is a canvas, and every flavor is a note in a symphony.\"",
